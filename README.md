# 👋 Hello, I'm Joel Sushanth Markapudi  

I'm a **Data Engineer turned AI Researcher** pursuing my **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence** at Northeastern University (Boston).  
I bridge **enterprise-scale data engineering** with **cutting-edge AI/ML research**—from **multi-agent debate frameworks** to **text-to-pose diffusion models**. My work spans across **data science, deep learning, computer vision, and MLOps**, with strong foundations in both **theory and production engineering**.

## 🧑‍💻 Research & Academic Projects

### 🔹 Text-to-Pose Diffusion (NeurIPS-style project)
- Built a **CLIP-conditioned diffusion model** for generating 3D human poses from text:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  
- Designed **cross-modal U-Net + cross-attention architecture**, with **anatomical loss constraints** for skeletal plausibility.  
- Innovated **cluster-aware sampling** and **first-action segmentation** on the **HumanML3D dataset** (~23k train / 4k test).  
- Result: Stable, anatomically correct pose generation with strong semantic alignment.  

### 🔹 Multi-Agent Debate LLMs
- Designed **SocrAItic Circle**: a multi-agent debate framework improving LLM reasoning:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.  
- Implemented **3-phase debate cycles** (prep → rebuttal → evaluation) and **7 judge types** (factual, logical, rhetorical, audience impact, etc.).  
- Created **YAML-driven prompt orchestration** and integrated **adversarial critique + evidence self-checking**.  
- Demonstrated measurable gains in **logical coherence, factual accuracy, and persuasiveness** compared to single-agent baselines.  

### 🔹 Multi-View 3D Scene Analysis & Reconstruction
- Built a **10,000+ LOC feature correspondence pipeline** for 3D reconstruction:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.  
- Developed **scene-adaptive correspondence** with pose-guided filtering, occlusion handling, and quality metrics.  
- Benchmarked on **ETH3D dataset**: achieved **+9.6% feature density** and improved stability across wide-baseline views.  
- Applications: surgical navigation, drone-based mapping, AR/VR pipelines.  

### 🔹 Protein Secondary Structure Prediction
- Implemented **HMM, CRF, SVM, and BiLSTM models** for predicting protein structures:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.  
- Enhanced CRF with **β-sheet specific features**, achieving **67.17% accuracy** (CB513 dataset).  
- Engineered rich features (PSSM, evolutionary profiles, structural indicators) with **sliding-window context extraction**.  

### 🔹 Artist Classification (Computer Vision)
- Compared **SVM+SIFT-BoVW**, **Convolutional Autoencoders**, and **CNNs (ResNet, VGG)** for artist identification:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.  
- SVM-SIFT achieved **89.2% accuracy on 50-class dataset**, outperforming CNNs under data constraints.
