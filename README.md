# üëã Hello, I'm Joel M  

AI Researcher & Data Engineer | M.S. in Artificial Intelligence @ Northeastern University, Boston  

I build systems at the intersection of **data engineering, deep learning, and applied research**.  
From **multi-agent debate LLMs** to **3D reconstruction pipelines** and **diffusion-based generative models**, I combine **theory, engineering, and experimentation** to solve complex problems.

## üìö Research & Academic Projects

### üîπ Text-to-Pose Diffusion (Cross-Modal AI)
- Built a **CLIP-conditioned diffusion model** generating 3D poses from natural language.  
- Designed **cross-modal U-Net + cross-attention** with **anatomical loss constraints** for skeletal validity.  
- Created **cluster-aware sampling + first-action segmentation** for the HumanML3D dataset (~23k train).  

### üîπ Multi-Agent Debate LLMs
- Developed **SocrAItic Circle**: multi-agent debate framework with **3-phase cycles** and **7 judge roles**.  
- Implemented **YAML-driven orchestration** and **adversarial critique + evidence self-checking** for robust reasoning.  
- Achieved stronger **logical coherence, factual accuracy, and persuasiveness** over single-agent baselines.  

### üîπ Multi-View 3D Scene Analysis
- Built a **scene-adaptive feature correspondence pipeline** (10k+ LOC) for ETH3D dataset.  
- Integrated **pose-guided filtering, occlusion handling, RANSAC validation**, and **spatial coverage metrics**.  
- Improved **feature density and track stability** in wide-baseline multi-view reconstruction.

### Other Notable Projects
- **Protein Secondary Structure Prediction**: Designed HMM, CRF, BiLSTM models; CRF reached 67% accuracy with evolutionary + sliding window features.  
- **Artist Classification (Vision)**: Compared **SVM-SIFT-BoVW, CAEs, CNNs**; SVM achieved 89.2% accuracy on 50-class dataset.  
- **DNA Sequence Matcher**: Implemented 7 string-matching algorithms (Suffix Tree, Aho-Corasick, EPMSPP) achieving **187 Mbp/s** on billion-base DNA inputs.
