## üìö Research & Academic Projects

- **Text-to-Pose Diffusion**: Built a CLIP-conditioned diffusion model with cross-attention + anatomical loss for 3D pose generation.  
- **Multi-Agent Debate LLMs**: Designed SocrAItic Circle with multi-phase debate cycles, YAML-driven orchestration, and judge modules.  
- **Multi-View 3D Scene Analysis**: Created a 10k+ LOC pipeline with MV scene analysis, pose-guided filtering, occlusion handling, and RANSAC validation on ETH3D.  
- **Protein Structure Prediction**: Implemented HMM, CRF, BiLSTM; CRF reached 67% accuracy on CB513 using evolutionary + context features.  
- **Artist Classification**: Compared SVM-SIFT-BoVW, CAEs, and CNNs; SVM achieved 89% accuracy on 50-class dataset.  
- **DNA Sequence Matcher**: Implemented 7 algorithms (Suffix Tree, Aho-Corasick, EPMSPP) achieving 187 Mbp/s throughput on genomic data.
