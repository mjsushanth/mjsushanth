## 📚 Research & Academic Projects

- **FinRAG/FinSights: Production-Grade Financial Intelligence System** — Hybrid dual-path architecture combining structured queries (DuckDB/SQL dimension tables) with semantic retrieval. Processes 72M→1M sentences via stratified sampling with temporal weighting across regulatory eras.
  - **Data Engineering Pipeline**: DuckDB stratified sampling (30+ SQL scripts) with weighted multi-objective scoring, fuzzy-matched S&P 500 integration, conditional temporal injection.
  - **Advanced RAG Engineering**: Sentence-level embeddings, **multi-query expansion with window-hopping retrieval**, citation provenance via document headers for exact traceability. End-to-end validation framework with Polars/Parquet logging, comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff, serverless-ready architecture (S3 Vectors + Lambda + Bedrock Claude).
  - Achieves $0.017/query cost through Parquet-based vector storage, eliminating managed DB overhead ($0.05/month vs $70-700/month). 
- **Text-to-Pose Diffusion**: Built a CLIP-conditioned diffusion model with cross-attention + anatomical loss for 3D pose generation.  
- **SocrAItic Circle**: Multi-Agent Debate LLMs workflow, designed with multi-phase debate cycles, iterative refinement, YAML-driven orchestration, and judge modules.  
- **Multi-View 3D Scene Analysis**: Created a 10k+ LOC pipeline with MV scene analysis, pose-guided filtering, occlusion handling, and RANSAC validation on ETH3D.  
- **Protein Structure Prediction**: Implemented HMM, CRF, BiLSTM; CRF reached 67% accuracy on CB513 using evolutionary + context features.  
- **Artist Classification**: Compared SVM-SIFT-BoVW, CAEs, VAEs, and CNNs; SVM achieved 89% accuracy on 50-class dataset.
